## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Thoughts

I almost used PostCSS to keep the CSS organized, but for now I decided to keep this solution as simple as possible since I'm only making a single component in isolation. Aside from adding a package dependency, that approach would also add an unnecessary compile step for the CSS.

For the responsive layout, I used the [Font-size Clamp Generator](https://clamp.font-size.app/) to use `clamp()` for font sizes and paddings that scale with the viewport, thus removing the need for media queries.
